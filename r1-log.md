**Today's Progress**: Today i have finally started to solve free code camp API projects using PHP framework Symfony. 
I restart project with Symfony 4.3 last week. but today I just make a code.
 Solve Timestamp Microservice, add description to Readme, and main page.

**Thoughts** : I know i had to to that early. Using this framework is an interesting experiece.

### September 2, Monday

**Today's progress**: Decide to reinvest the wheel. Trying to make own router through object instead of "switch" and "if" statemans

**Thoughts**: At first it was hard to understanding, but after creating the literal object i did that. think my solution is very ugly and absolutely shrinked router.
